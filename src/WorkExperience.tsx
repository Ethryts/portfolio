                    As a summer intern at Nutrien, I quickly learned their internal systems and python development principles to help supercharge team efforts. I created novel solutions to unblock long-term business requests and designed and developed document templates and integration scripts for the dynamic creation of inspection documents for long-term storage of at-risk materials to comply with audits from the United States Department of Defence.

                <p className="m-5">

                    These tasks earned me a part-time position as a software developer on the team. I continued to help improve the developer experience through various DevOps improvements. These included improving test-ability, error handling, and logging, as well as opening up avenues for the generation of an improved standard library for an internal Safety Health and Environmental codebase.
