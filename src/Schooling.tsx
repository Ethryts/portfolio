                At Saskatchewan Polytechnic, I gained hands-on experience managing computer systems, both hardware and software. As part of my CST program, I learned how to administer large computer networks, automate deployment, and handle large datasets using VBA, Excel, Access, and Java.

                In addition to systems management, I also gained experience in software development. Over the span of a year and a half, my team and I developed multiple large software projects for both mock internal clients and real-world small businesses, using agile methodologies and small team development. We cooperated with 5-8 other developers to achieve the desired software solution.
                I also have experience designing and developing web applications using web design principles and web-first development. I have utilized web development technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, and object-relational mappers to develop reactive web applications. I have designed front-end applications, routing, and developed custom APIs, and have worked with multiple front-end and back-end frameworks.
